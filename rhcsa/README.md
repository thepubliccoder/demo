## The RHCSA lab environment
> NOTE: This virtual lab environment is only tested on Mac OS X

> NOTE: These instructions are for machines that already have the demo project installed.  If you have not installed the demo project yet, follow the instructions in the demo project's [```README.md```](https://github.com/dmbrownlee/demo/blob/master/README.md) first.

## Configure the virtual lab environment for a specific study group (RHCSA)
Ensure you have the latest version of the demo project and run the ```setup``` script in the parent directory with ```rhcsa``` as the only argument to setup this virtual lab environment.  You can do this with the following command:

```cd ~/demo && git pull && ./setup rhcsa```  

# Happy Learning!
