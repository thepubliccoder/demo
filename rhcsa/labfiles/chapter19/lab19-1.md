# lab19-1: Bash Shell Scripting
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice creating a shell script that takes arguments and
generates a DNS zone file.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

- Create a shell script that meets these criteria:
  - The script runs like any other command (so long as it is in the path).
  - The script takes a single argument, a string of an IPv4 netblock (e.g.
    192.168.1.0).
  - The script creates a DNS zone file (which is just text) on STDOUT beginning
    with this header:
_______________________________________________________________________________
$ORIGIN example.com.
@                      3600 SOA   ns1.example.com. (
                              zone-admin.example.com.    ; address of responsible party
                              <DATE>                     ; serial number
                              3600                       ; refresh period
                              600                        ; retry period
                              604800                     ; expire time
                              1800                     ) ; minimum ttl
                      86400 NS    ns1.example.com.
                      86400 NS    ns2.example.com.
                       3600 MX    10 mail.example.com.
_______________________________________________________________________________

  - Replace <DATE> in the header above with the date in YYYYmmddHHMM format.
  - After the above header, include lines that look like this:

dhcp<HOST>    60 A    <PREFIX>.<HOST>

  - Each line above should replace <PREFIX> with the first three octets of the
    network address passed as the first argument on the command line and <HOST>
    with the numbers 100 through 199.

NOTE
Don't get too fancy.  The goal is to demonstrate you can make a script that
loops, not the world's best shell script ever.
