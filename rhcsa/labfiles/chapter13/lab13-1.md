# lab13-1: Practice configuring rsyslogd
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

Make sure you know how to configure system logging

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS
You should be able to do this on any virtual machine or the host OS.
1.  Look at /etc/rsyslog.conf and see if you can tell where the local4 facility
    will log messages of priority "info" or higher
2.  Test your guess using:

      logger -p local4.warn "Testing local4 warnings"

3.  Change the configuration so that local4.debug messages and higher also log
    to /var/log/local4.log
4.  Check your work using:

      logger -p local4.debug "Testing local4 debug messages"

    Verify your message appears in /var/log/local4.log but not in the original
    log destination
5.  Configure logrotate to rotate the file daily and keep only 5 days worth of
    logs.
6.  Remember to undo your changes before the logs fill the harddrive
