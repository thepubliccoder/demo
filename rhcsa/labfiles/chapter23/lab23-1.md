# lab23-1: Firewall configuration
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will practice configuring the firewall on server2 using 
firewall-cmd.  The firewall is already configured but you can make it better.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as root and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab23/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK

## STEPS

Note, the VMs have two network interfaces.  One of the network interfaces is
on a private network that vagrant uses to manage the VMs from the host OS.
This network only needs to allow SSH connections.  The other network interface
is what the VM uses to communicate with the Internet.  Identify which interface
is which before beginning.

1.  Assign the private interface vagrant uses to the "trusted" zone
2.  Make sure the trusted interface above accepts inbound SSH connections
3.  Assign the other interface to the "internal" zone
4.  Make sure the internal interface also accepts inbound SSH
5.  Make "internal" the default zone
6.  Make all your changes permanent and verify after rebooting
