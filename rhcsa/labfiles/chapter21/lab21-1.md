# lab21-1: Apache VirtualHost
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will prove you can configure an Apache VirtualHost and test
it from another machine.  You will know you can have completed the lab
successfully when you can use Firefox on server1 to see the PHP information
page at http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php.

## SETUP

Log into server2 as root and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab17/setup-server2

This will install Apache with PHP support, create the virtual host's
web content, and disable SELinux.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server1 as user, open Firefox, and confirm the URL
    http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php does not currently work.
2.  Login to server2 as root and configure a name-based VirtualHost with
    testweb.example.com as the virtual hostname and /var/www-testweb as
    the DocumentRoot
3.  Troubleshoot until you can view the PHP info page in Firefox at
    http://testweb.example.com/phpinfo.php (if you get stuck, there is a
    HINTS file in this directory).
