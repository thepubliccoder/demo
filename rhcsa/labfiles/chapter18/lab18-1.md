# lab18-1: GRUB troubleshooting
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will
know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

## SETUP

Log into server2 as root and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab18/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK

This will break the machine.  As the name implies, don't look at
setup-server2-DONT_LOOK as that will give away how the machine was
broken and figuring that out is the point of the exercise

## STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.  Here is the scenario:

   The user used to have a veritically oriented monitor.  He was trying to
   change the monitor orientation back to horizontal but couldn't remember
   how he originally configured it.  He thought the problem was in the
   grub.cfg file and tried to edit it but, not being proficient in vim, he
   he the wrong keys and messed things up.  He tried to undo his accidental
   changes but must of missed something and now his machine won't boot.  He
   is now turning to you, the professional.  ;)
