=== LAB 18.2: Troubleshooting the boot process

OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will troubleshoot a machine that won't boot.  You will
know you have successfully completed the lab when you can boot the machine

SETUP

Log into server2 as root and run:

  ansible-playbook /labfiles/lab18.2/setup-server2-DONT_LOOK

This will break the machine.  As the name implies, don't look at
setup-server2-DONT_LOOK as that will give away how the machine was
broken and figuring that out is the point of the exercise

STEPS

1. Get server2 working again.
