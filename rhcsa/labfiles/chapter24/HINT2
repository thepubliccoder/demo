It can be helpful to know how to see which Kerberos principals exist in a
keytab file.  The host's keytab file is /etc/krb5.keytab and you can use the
ktutil program to view its contents.  ktutil is an interactive program and a
sample session of using it looks like this.

$ ktutil
ktutil:  rkt /etc/rkb5.keytab
ktutil:  list
slot KVNO Principal
---- ---- -----------------------------------------------------------------
   1    1     host/server2.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
   2    1     host/server2.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
   3    1      nfs/server2.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
   4    1      nfs/server2.example.com@EXAMPLE.COM
ktutil:  quit
$

In order for the host to use Kerberized NFS, the host's keytab file must
include the NFS principals (the principals beginning with nfs/...).  The
"ipa-getkeytab..." step in the instructions is the step adding the NFS
principals to the host's keytab file.
