# lab24-1: Firewalls and NFS RPCs (showmount and rpcinfo)
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

The warning in the middle of p516 says firewalls can break the showmount
command and that is the case with our machines.  In this lab, you will learn
to fix that.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

1.  Login to server2 as root and run "showmount -e labipa.example.com" to find
    that it actually does work
2.  Login to labipa and check the status of the firewall to verify it is, in
    fact, running
3.  View the firewall rules to see if you can figure out why showmount works
    when the book suggests it should be broken
4.  If you think if found the answer, change the firewall rules temporarily to
    test your hypothesis
