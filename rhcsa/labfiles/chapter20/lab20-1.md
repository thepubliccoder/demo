# lab20-1: Lock down sshd
## <img align="left" src="../images/ConstructionSign.png">Sorry, this lab has not been reviewed recently and may contain:
  - outdated technical informatiom
  - spelling errors, grammar errors, and poor markdown formatting

## OBJECTIVE

In this lab, you will tighten security on sshd

## SETUP

For this lab, login to server2 but make the changes remotely on server1. Do not
log into server1 directly via the Virtual Machine Manager app.  Imagine server1
is on the other side of town and, if you accidentally lock yourself out, you
will need to spend 90 minutes in traffic to visit the server1's physical
location to fix it.

## STEPS

1.  On server2, as user "user", generate an ssh keypair if you don't already
    have one and do what's necessary to allow user to ssh from server2 to
    server1 without a password.
2.  After verifying passwordless logins work, disable password logins for all
    users.
3.  Configure the sshd so that is only accepts incoming ssh connections from
    user "user".
4.  Configure sshd to run on port 2022
5.  Verify SELinux is in "Enforcing" mode and enable it if it isn't
