# lab0-1: Create your schedule

## OBJECTIVE

Commit to a study schedule and block out time so you can stick with it.

## SETUP

There are no special setup steps for this lab.

## STEPS

Many study guides start by suggesting you commit to a study schedule and block out time so you can stick with it. Some go so far as to suggest you pay for the exam and schedule it before you have finished reading the study guide just to pressure yourself into completing it.  We won't go that far here, but it is good to set goals for yourself in the form of a timeline so you can quickly see when you are falling behind and take steps to course correct.

To help you with this, we have provided a tab separated values (TSV) document with helpful links back to the assignment pages here which you can import into a spreadsheet.  Once imported, you can fill in the dates by which you would like to complete each chapter.

1. Import this TSV file into a spreadsheet.

  [```rhcsa-schedule-template.tsv```](../rhcsa-schedule-template.tsv)

  If your spreadsheet is web based, you may want to bookmark it in your browser.

  > For fun: After you import the schedule template, delete the empty columns and rows, resize column B so you can see the full text of the links, and set the fonts and heading color to anything you like.

1. Assign dates in the first column to specify when you would like to finish each chapter.

  > Tip: The schedule template lists the number of pages per chapter but only you know how fast you read and how mauch time you have available for study.  Besides reading time, make sure you give yourself adequate time to work through the labs here and in the book.  Preparing for the RHCSA exam requires hands-on practice to develop skills.

  > Tip: Make sure you are looking at your calendar while you do this so you can plan around vacations and busy holidays.  You may also want to add additional rows intermittently for review weeks.

1. Block out time in your actual calendar for study.

  > Tip: If you use a web based calendar and schedule spreadsheet, create your recurring calendar event with a link to your schedule spreadsheet.  When you get your calendar notification, you can go directly to the schedule spreadsheet and from there go to the assignment page which has links to the source material and labs.

1. Finally, do whatever is necessary to create a workable study environment.

  > Tip: If you will be taking the exam remotely, you might take a look at the requirements for the remote exam environment as mentioned in [Red Hat's FAQ](https://www.redhat.com/en/resources/certification-remote-exams-FAQ) and then configure your study environment to meet the requirements so the environment is comfortable by the time you take the test.
